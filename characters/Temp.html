            The Ice King, whose real name is Simon Petrikov, is one of the main
            antagonists and a tragic figure in Adventure Time. Once a kind and
            intelligent archaeologist, Simon became the Ice King after he found
            a cursed crown that granted him powerful ice magic. Over time, the
            crown drove him mad, erasing his memories and transforming him into
            a lonely, eccentric villain. He has the ability to summon ice and
            snow, and often tries to kidnap princesses, believing that they are
            the key to filling the void of his loneliness.
