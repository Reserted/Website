                <h1> Finn </h1>
                <p>Finn Mertens, better known as Finn the Human, is the brave, goofy, and big-hearted hero at the center of Adventure Time. Adopted by Jake’s family, he grew up with Jake as both his brother and best friend, sharing countless quests and adventures across the Land of Ooo. Starting out as a wide-eyed 12-year-old and growing into a wiser 17-year-old, Finn learns that being a hero is about more than just swinging his swords—it’s about caring for others and understanding the complexities of the world. With his green backpack, iconic white hat, and endless sense of justice, Finn embodies courage, kindness, and the journey of growing up.</p></div>
